 INTRODUCTION
---------------

Welcome!  SteerSuite is a set of test cases, tools, and a C++ library
for developing and evaluating agent steering AI behaviors.

The SteerSuite web page is:

  http://steersuite.eecs.yorku.ca/

On the web page you can find a description of SteerSuite, download the
latest version of SteerSuite, read the latest documentation, and join
the discussion group.

Please send us any comments and feedback about how to make SteerSuite
easier to use.  Your input is greatly appreciated.

Enjoy!

 DOCUMENTATION
----------------

If you want to build your own documentation from this package, read
the file documentation/readme.txt for more information.  Otherwise,
the latest documentation can be found at the SteerSuite web page at:

  http://steersuite.eecs.yorku.ca/

The documentation includes:

  - The User Guide explains how to use most features of SteerSuite
  - The Reference Manual contains a comprehensive listing of
    SteerSuite components
  - The Code Reference is doxygen-generated documentation of the C++
    code.

 DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
----------------------

The directory structure of this package is as follows:

  - build/          - Unix scripts and Visual Studio 2012 solution file 
                  to compile all components of SteerSuite.
  - documentation/  - raw unprocessed documentation and instructions for
                  building the documentation.
  - external/       - external dependencies that are (legally) included
                  for convenience, but NOT part of SteerSuite.
  - kdtree/         - Spatial Database module for a kdtree type spatial databse.
  - navmeshBuilder/ - Module to build navigation meshes during runtime. Uses Recast.
  - pprAI/          - source directory for the PPR steering module, a
                  demo steering algorithm for SteerSim.
  - rvo2AI/         - source directory for the ORCA steering module, based
                  on the RVO2 steering algorithm library.
  - reactiveAI/     - source directory for the reactive steering module, a
                  demo steering algorithm for SteerSim (just the 
                  reactive appraoch of PPR).
  - socialForcesAI/ - source directory for the social foces steering module, a
                  implementation of the social forces steering algorithm.
  - simpleAI/       - source directory for the simpleAI module, a basic
                  demo plugin for SteerSim.
  - steerbench/     - source directory for SteerBench, a tool used to
                  score and analyze steering AI.
  - steerlib/       - source directory for SteerLib, a shared library
                  containing most of SteerSuite's functionality.
  - steersim/       - source directory for SteerSim, a modular simulation
                  tool.
  - steertool/      - source directory for SteerTool, a utility for useful
                  miscellaneous tasks
  - testcases/      - XML test cases and the XML schema describing the
                  test case format.

 COMPILING STEERSUITE
-----------------------

Below are quick instructions for compiling with default options. For
more complete instructions, refer to the SteerSuite User Guide.  

As with any graphics library you will need to make sure you already have the
opengl libraries on you computer. For example on Ubuntu 14.04 you will want
to install
```
freeglut3-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev libglew1.6-dev mesa-utils libglew-dev premake4 libxrandr-dev
```
This will install opengl, glew and freegult.  

On Windows you will need to download freeglut.lib and the opengl header files and put them in your library path, tyically C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\lib\amd64 for freeglut.lib and C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\include for the GL folder.

Note: The build system has been updated and now uses **premake4**. You are going to need to have this installed 
to be able to build the software.

Windows 7/8 with Visual Studio 2012:
  1. premake vs2012
  2. Choose Debug/Release and 32/64 bit mode,
  3. Most components should compile successfully.
  4. All compiled components will be in the build/bin folder.

Linux/Unix:
  1. From a command line, go to the build/ directory
  2. premake4 gmake
      - make sure you are in the build/ directory.
  3. Go into the newly created gmake directory and run
      - make config=[debug64|release64]
      - Depending on your preference for the type of build you want to perform you can build a debug version or a release version.
  4. All components are copied into the build/bin/ and build/lib/ directories.
     
Mac OS X:
  For now, the process is the same as Linux/Unix.  With OS X version
  10.4 or earlier, you may need to use an LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
  variable for the executable to properly link with shared and dynamic
  libraries.
